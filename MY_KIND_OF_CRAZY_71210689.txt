My Kind of Crazy (Feat. Dipha Barus) - Raisa

A quiet morning 
You by my side
Got nowhere to be
Nowhere that I would be

come closer, baby
Your skin to mine
It's not complicated
Just do what we do naturally
By my side, my side

And this is all whatever this to me
Your touch or your smile at the morning light
Pull me inside out and set me free
Baby let's go, don't you hesitate

You can't fake this chemistry
Take me where you wanna go
Every time feels like a brand new
Baby

Love is softer love is true
Don't want it any other way
You, my kind of crazy

just like a movie
Our love can be
Feeling in romantic
And sometimes i wish i could fast forward
When we fight
